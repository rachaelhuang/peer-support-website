      <p>Over the past few terms, we’ve been collaborating with staff at the SWC to improve the current Peer Support model.
        They have proposed a Peer Coach internship program, where 3-5 students will join the SWC’s Wellness Check-in team.</p>

      <p>This paid internship is available for ‘26s, ‘27s, and ‘28s and will allow selected students to actively use the skills
        they gained through Peer Support training. For more information, please reach out to us at mhu@dartmouth.edu or
        to our peer support student directors: </p>
